# Half Life iOS Test

This is a test written by Half Life for evaluating iOS developer candidates.

## Test steps

1. We have setup a simple mock API. You can find the documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/760137/SzRxVqNf?version=latest)
2. We have setup a skeleton Swift iOS project for a todo application
3. Do a very simple implementation of the API in the Swift application
4. The API returns static data - use your judgement on the most appropriate API implementation points

## Submitting guidelines

You can fork this repo, and make changes into the forked repo in your own personal github account.

When you are satisfied with your work, please share the public repo in your github account with your Half Life recruitment contact.

We will evaluate your submission and get back to you as soon as possible!

Good luck!
